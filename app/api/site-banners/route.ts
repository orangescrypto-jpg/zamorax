// app/api/site-banners/route.ts
// Public, unauthenticated read for the header/footer promo banners.
// HeaderBanner/FooterBanner were going through AdminService._ref_() ->
// /api/d1/query, which requires a valid Supabase session on every request
// (by design, since it's the shared proxy for all authenticated app data).
// That meant logged-out visitors — most of the traffic on a public
// homepage — got a silent 401, swallowed into an empty snapshot by the
// onSnapshot shim, so the banner just never showed for anyone not logged in.
// This route is a dedicated public GET so banners work for every visitor,
// matching the pattern used by /api/config and /api/admin/settings.
