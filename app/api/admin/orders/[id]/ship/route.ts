// app/api/admin/orders/[id]/ship/route.ts
// Admin/moderator-only: mark an order as shipped by Zamorax (goods are
// already physically with Zamorax, so Zamorax staff — not the seller — will
// handle it from here).
//
// GATED to official orders only:
//   - the listing was admin-picked for "Zamorax Direct" (listings.is_zamorax_pick), OR
//   - the seller's account itself is official (users.is_official)
// Any other order is rejected with 403 — for a regular (non-official) order,
// only the seller can mark it shipped, same as today.
//
// This route ONLY changes fulfillment tracking (fulfilled_by /
// marked_shipped_by / marked_shipped_at) and the order status. It never
// touches seller_payout, escrow_status, or wallet balances — money still
// reaches the seller's wallet exactly the way it always has, via the normal
// escrow-release flow once the buyer confirms delivery (or auto-release).
